# ESP32-Open-Hotspot-Finder
A nice little gadget which blinks if it has found a open Wifi Hotspot and can ping to 1.1.1.1

This is a little project to get in touch with ESP32. 
It scans the WiFi nets and if there is a net without encryption it connects.
Than it try to ping 1.1.1.1. If it get a ping back from 1.1.1.1 it blinks the internal LED 10 times.
Than it's your part to take your smartphone and connect to the net.
